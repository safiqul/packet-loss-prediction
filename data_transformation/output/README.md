# Where to find the ss output files

As the data collection procedure grew increasingly complex, so too did the converted csv files. Eventually, the files became so large that GitHub could not host them anymore. A first attempt at circumventing this by using Git Large File Storage failed because the UiO enterprise server is seemingly not configured to support this. The hosting of the converted csv files was therefore moved to Google Drive, where all the [relevant output files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1orql-u-Bl5RXf3UT5_hy8BVcLvBW_XgA?usp=sharing) are available.
